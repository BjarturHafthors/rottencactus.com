<h2>BY ROTTEN CACTUS</h2>

<h4 id="desc">A video game that helps people understand mental disorders from the perspective of those diagnosed.</h4>

<h3 id="problemH">Problem</h3>

<h4 id="difficultyH">Difficulty levels</h4>

<p id="difficultyP">It can be hard to keep the difficulty levels of video games balanced. Games tend to be either too simple, or too difficult, both of which can cause the player frustration if the problem persists for a long time. This frustration may in turn cause the player to stop playing the game and review it poorly, thus decreasing the sale and income possibilities of the game.</p>

<h3 id="illnessH">Mental Disorders</h3>

<h4 id="prevalenceH">Prevalence</h4>

<p id="prevalenceP">The National Institute of Mental Health‘s (NIMH) results indicate that about 18.1% of adults and 13.1% of children are inflicted with some mental disorder every year. They also suggest that about 46.3% of children have at one time in their life had a diagnosable mental disorder. This same problem is also found on Iceland, with the research of Stefánsson and Líndal suggesting that the life prevalence of mental disorders is about 49.8% and the 12 month prevalence about 19.7%.
</p>

<h4 id="deathRateH">Mortality</h4>

<p id="deathRateP">It is assumed that people with mental disorders die on average 25 years earlier than people without mental disorders, and this is influenced by multiple factors. The most direct influence is through suicide and self-injury, with suicide being the 10th most common cause of death for adults, the 3rd most common for children between the ages of 10 and 14 and the 2nd most common for young adults between the ages of 15 and 34. Not all suicides are commited due to a mental disorder, however, over 90% of people who commit suicide do have one or more mental disorder. The effect of mental disorder can also be more indirect, for example through mood disorders (e.g. depression and bipolar disorder), which are the 3rd most common reason for people to be signed into a hospital. The World Health Organization (WHO) also estimates that mental disorders are the main reason for disability in the United States, making up 27.1% of disabled people.
</p>

<h4 id="costH">Cost</h4>

<p id="costP">The World Economic Forum estimated that in 2010 the society’s cost due to mental disorders reached 2.5 trillion dollars, the largest sum of all diseases and disorders. They also estimated that by the year 2030 this cost would have reached 6 trillion dollars, more than the combined estimated costs of cancer, diabetes, and respiratory disorders. This cost is largely due to strain on the health care system and the educational system, people with mental disorders taking multiple sick days, and prison cost.</p>

<h4 id="prejudiceH">Stigma</h4>

<p id="prejudiceP">There is a lot of stigma towards people with mental disorders in today’s society, coming from all directions, 46% of teenagers with mental disorders state that their family members show prejudice due to their disorders and 63% experience prejudice from their peers, leading to a loss of friends and rejection. This may cause people to lose all social connections, have low self-esteem and may even cause great troubles during treatment.</p>

<h3 id="solutionH">Solution</h3>

<p id="solutionP">The idea is to design a video game, Sonder. The game is supposed to help its players understand mental disorders from the perspective of those who have been diagnosed with such disorders. This is done in order to decrease societal stigma, increase understanding, and open the subject up for public discussion. When the subject is more common in daily discussion, stigma and prejudice decreases, and this in turn causes the subject to become less taboo. This causes people diagnosed with mental disorders to experience their diagnoses in a more positive light and so they become less ashamed of themselves. People who know those with mental disorders are also more likely to support them and encourage them to seek the help they need rather than belittling their problems. People with mental disorders are thus more likely to seek help and are more likely to talk about their problems. Due to this, societal cost from mental disorders decreases.
In addition, we have designed a system which implements machine learning methods in order to adapt the game’s difficulty to each player. The players should thus enjoy the game more and each player receive a difficulty level suitable for them.
</p>

<h3 id="implementationH">Implementation</h3>

<p id="implementationP">The game will be implemented by using various narrative technologies in order to educate the player about mental disorders, mostly subconsciously. This will be done by studying the disorders’ symptoms and consider how they could be placed into a game, through e.g. sounds, colours, metaphors and other common methods. Special emphasis will be placed on using the video game media as such, i.e. not by creating a story in which the player is a simple spectator, instead, the player will take an active part in the story’s creation and have control over what happens. Case studies will also be studied, as well as interviewing people with mental disorders in order to not just have general quantitative data, but also see the human side of the disorders. The CEO of Vinakot, Aðalheiður Þóra Bragadóttir, helps us reach this goal, Vinakot offers housing to teenagers, and there we have access to teenagers with mental disorders, both for interviewing and game testing. Through this cooperation we can make sure we are really mediating information from the perspective of people with mental disorders.
The difficulty is adjusted using the players’ success rates, which will be calculated by the computer, using various data from the gameplay. If the success rate is deemed either too great or too small, compared to a set benchmark, the difficulty is adjusted accordingly.
</p>

<h3 id="competitionH">Competition</h3>

<p id="competitionP">This is not the first time a video game is designed with the goal of introducing its players to the perspective of those with mental disorders, but it has however not been done frequently. One of the most principal example is the game Depression Quest by Zoe Quinn, it does however not make full use of the video game medium as such, since the game is text-based, the only thing the player does is reading stories and pressing options. Other games that have done this to some extent are e.g. Darkest Dungeon by Red Hook Games and Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice by Ninja Theory. Darkest Dungeon includes a stress meter that the player has to make sure does not fill up and Hellblade includes a schizophrenic protagonist. One thing that all games in this area have in common though is that they do not cover a variety of mental disorders, choosing instead to discuss only one, and usually the mental disorder is not where the emphasis lies, but more of an extra feature.
</p>

<h3 id="marketH">Market</h3>

<p id="marketP">The goal is not to limit the game to a single market, but one has to begin somewhere. At first the game mostly be marketed towards Icelanders, and it will pander to the younger generation due to them being more susceptible to learning, thus increasing the game’s influence on the future’s paradigms and values. The game will however be in English.
The game will at first either be created for the smartphone market (Androis, iOS) or the computer market (Windows, Mac). At first, our main target market will thus be young, English-speaking Icelanders who are part of either the smart phone market or the computer market, and the aim is to publish the game on the other market shortly afterwards. If all goes well, the target market will be expanded and marketing outside of Iceland will commence.
There is also a possibility to sell the game to institutions such as schools and clinical treatment centres for educational purposes.
</p>

<h3 id="businessModelH">Business Model</h3>

<p id="businessModelP">As previously stated, a decision has not been taken whether to aim for the smartphone market or the computer market at first, and the business model will be formed based on this decision. If the smartphone market is chosen, it will be free to download the game, but there will be advertisements in the game, which can only be removed by paying a fee. Permission would be asked to make the game downloadable on both App Store (iOS) and Play Store (Android). In addition, there will be a shop within the game which offers customizing options, these can be bought with tokens which are either received within the game itself or bought for money. If the computer market is chosen, the aim is to publish the game on Steam, the world’s largest digital distribution platform. The game would be sold for a set charge and later the players’ would be offered the option to buy additional features.
Grants
We have only applied for one grant presently,
</p>

<h3 id="fundsH">Grants</h3>

<p id="fundsP"> We have only applied for one grant at present, the Action for Job Creation, an innovation grant donated by the Innovation Center of Iceland. The grant is donated to innovators who focus on the economy, and we believe this game can help by challenging prejudice towards mental disorders on the job market, thus improving people’s working conditions. In our application, we asked for one million ISK, this amount would greatly speed up the game’s progress seeing that the team members could then focus all their efforts on the project rather than working alongside it. </p>

<h3 id="futurePlansH"> Future plans </h3>

<p id="futurePlansP"> As previously stated, the game will initially be published on one of two markets. The aim is to publish it on the other shortly afterwards. Additional features will be added regularly to increase the game’s playability and entertainment value. In addition, staff members will be added when necessary, and the company has a regularly updated document with information on people considered viable for job interviews. It is also important to find office space for the company. Additionally, advertisements will be needed to display in the smartphone version of the game, this will most likely be done through services such as Google Ads. </p>

<h3 id="summaryH"> Summary </h3>

<p id="summaryP">Mental disorders make up a large problem in today’s societies. We at Rotten Cactus have decided to do our best to deal with this problem by creating the video game Sonder, a game made to help its players to understand mental disorders from the perspective of those who are diagnosed with them. The team consists of a programmer, a visual designer and a psychological researcher, all of which have great ambition towards finishing this project.</p>
